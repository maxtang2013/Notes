                    I deeply admire that because you can transpose this mindset in anything else.<br/><br/>

                    But now Tai that you\'ve been able to accumulate all this material wealth what are you going to do with it?<br/>
                    How do you concretly help our planet?<br/>
                    Is your wealth based on having or giving?<br/>
                    I think you inspire a lot of us by showing us that if you have a goal you can reach it.<br/>
                    But now what do you do with all this money?<br/><br/>

                    You keep spending on stuff that has no value for the whole humanity but only for your own comfort or you want to contribute significally?<br/><br/>

                    Materialistic things are nice for period of time, but after a while you can see that it has no real value.<br/><br/>

                    My question for you is:<br/>
                    What\'s your direction for the future?<br/>
                    Why is it that direction?<br/><br/>

                    And continue by the way showing us that you can reach goals, but the materialistic thing part of your i don\'t see any value of that stuff.<br/>
                    The human kind faces challenge right now and I would be deeply inspired by seeing that you are contributing concretly to those.<br/>

                <div class=\"dtl\">Tai Lopez i can definitely relate to your story at least the begining of it. I was born and raised IN San Fernando (Los Angeles California). The guy that changed my life was Tony Robbins which led me to Financial Services Industry. After 7 years of being in Financial World i have read many books, went to many conferences, had mentors studied a lot period. For the past 2 years the most powerful information i have acquired has been because of Tai Lopez 67 Steps, conferences and book recommendations. Thanks Tai. I am still on my journey to super success but with your help i have opened many new doors i didnt know existed. I would put Tai as top 10 most influential people in my life.</div>

                <div class=\"dtl\">I have not been able to complete the 67 steps...however, I took heart from the plethora of videos, book studies...because that is what they are, and advice that fuels my ambition and have gone from the lowest paid employee at my firm to the highest paid employee at my firm, and I did it in less than two years. But I\'m not done yet...I want to own the company, build the company, and explode my potential. My wife and I are so happy that money is no longer stress, but joy when we look at our burgeoning account and give back to the causes we love. Scientia est potitia...knowledge is power.</div>

                <div class=\"dtl\">After I bought the 67 Steps I had less than $6 dollars in my bank account. I was living with my financially irresponsible and incredibly unhealthy mom and step-dad at the time, during the lowest point in my life. I was always depressed, had zero energy, and couldn\'t muster enthusiasm for things that I had loved earlier in life. I saw Tai\'s ad, liked what he had to say, and bought the course. I\'ve been studying biographies, personal development, and success psychology for years, and I can honestly say that I\'ve never seen a more concise and actionable distillation of knowledge regarding improving one\'s situation. I learned so much that gave me hope and direction again. After completing the course I moved out, left for California on my own, and am working on my personal Master Plan to get back in shape, get out of debt, meet some amazing mentors, and become the person I know I\'m capable of. Thanks for everything Tai. I\'ll meet you in person someday, and hopefully even take a ride in the Lambo or play with Booker :) Learn on. -Will</div>

                <div class=\"dtl\"> I was depressed working overnights. One day I started scouting the internet searching for why I didn\'t feel successful. I stumbled upon Tai Lopez on YouTube. His discussions motivated me to pick up a book and educate myself. I bought \"how to win friends and influence people.\" Little did I know that this small action fueled by just a little inspiration and belief in his advice would fuel me to change my life drastically. I quit my night shift job with no plan and now only 1 month later, I am jogging every morning, I have changed my diet completely, I found d a job that fits around my life passions and pursues the opportunities I desire. I meditate daily and am an ambitious seeker of knowledge. I found out i love psychology. I am 100% happy all around. All it took was a pep talk from Tai Lopez and belief that everything would work out. I have made more progress in 1 month than I have in 1 year. Thank you Tai Lopez for the inspiration.</div>

                <div class=\"dtl\"> i want to put this simple as possible. listen to the 67 steps and you will see life different i cant explain why but you almost start to crave the knowledge from anyone and anything. my family that i have not seen in a very long time tell me that i have changed because i never liked books and notice how healthy i have become. this me in 2 years yea i dont look like much but i only workout out 3 days a week and have time for other things. the reason i dont see my family much is because i am in the military...</div>

                <div class=\"dtl\"> Because of the knowledge you\'ve given me and the encouragement, I\'ve been able to get sober. I quit smoking, drinking, and doing drugs. I\'m working on my health and losing weight. I\'m getting into business and looking for that passive income so I can fulfil my dream of traveling. I\'ve nearly diminished my depression. I\'m extremely more confident and happy. I have more social skills now. I\'m working on my own program to help the people in my community. That\'s just a little bit of it all! After seeing your ad on youtube, and realizing it popped up for a reason, I watched it. Taking that action and getting your knowledge was one of the best things that I\'ve ever done. I greatly appreciate what you\'ve done, not just for me but for everyone else. Thank you Tai. Stay strong!</div>

I found ways to make money quick. So anything is possible. No one should ever feel trapped. Be confident that you will figure things out</div>

                <div class=\"dtl\"> I have finished the 67 Steps last week. And would absolutely recommend it to everyone. I believe it has the potential to change you life. But above all, as Tai and other mentors put it, you have to participate in this.<br/>
                    I live in Prague and people here in Middle Europe are much more pessimistic and cynical than in California. So they often don\'t get it. Why I\'m paying for something like that when everyone knows the best way in life is to simply get a job maybe some day you\'ll be promoted... and you can\'t change your life anyway.... Whatever. I just keep recommending Tai\'s programs to everyone who wants a change in his life.<br/>
                    I really can\'t say anything that has not been already said by my fellow 67 Steppers above. Thanks a lot Tai!</div>

Aware of why I am where I am, aware of what I\'m passionate about, and aware of how precious time is. I\'m beginning to live more intentionally and in a forward thinking mindset. Excited about what\'s to come. Thanks again! Also, what\'s he book in your hands? Need to get it. Peace.</div>

                <div class=\"dtl\">Where do i start? I was a kid in high school who was looking for a career in the automotive industry. I was able to be enrolled in a university to study for automotive. So i had to move away from my family. I worked to pay for school. So i did school, work, school, work, to and fro. It was very draining. I was showed a presentation for a network marketing company and i just loved it. It was so simple i didn\'t see why i should say no. (maybe you\'d like it haha) so i jumped on board. And one day i saw your youtube ad, \"here in my garage\" lol and i saw all of it. I even clicked on the link. Being so open minded was so much better than being closed minded. Anyway, i saw your videos. All of them. I\'ve seen every single one. I loved them. Then one day i decided to stop out of the university i was attending. I wasn\'t makink residual money yet but i had so much faith in my company i knew i would be okay. When i decided to take a trip back to my hometown it turns out my brother was also watching your videos. So i also thought i should show him my network marketing opportunity and he loved it. Jumped right on and made some moves. Took action, read books, applied the knowledge we learned and tweaked it when we needed to. So thank you Tai Lopez for helping us \"regular\" folks.</div>

                <div class=\"dtl\">Impressive as I am doing things backwards. I am in my PhD program and now having tons of student loans I am gravitating away from the educational system into my own personal business. This was something I always wanted to do but family pushed college college college. Today\'s society and unstable workplaces has college grads struggling to find work in their fields. If you have a passion, use that as a Segway into a business plan and surround yourself with positive Smart people and you will succeed. As a product of the educational system, it is always not the answer for success. Just some thoughts for your followers partner. Be well.</div>

                <div class=\"dtl\"> Writing you a comment which takes 4-5 minutes max is nothing in comparacens to the time you\'ve taken to make us all the 67 steps. Humility is key, so this comment is my duty I feel like the 67 steps brings me back to the happiness I had when I was 5, and I hadn\'t yet been intoxicated with the way societey works. Together we push towards a goal, and thank you for helping all the people you\'ve helped. The way I feel you care about us, the Mini Mentors, what you tell us. I feel so bold, I feel like I finally breath as a kid again and I can\'t wait for my next day to start. Because everyday right now is a working process towards my goals, and I can feel it. I can\'t wait to express myself with success. You are the best at what you do Tai, and you\'ve earned that. I will do all I can to one day meet you in person, whatever time you have I will not give up, I\'ll buy you lunch just let me by you lunch Tai, a five minute lunch the fastest lunch you\'ll ever have ever hahaha. Back to the point. I will would by 67 steps for allt the money I had if i had to do it. I would put away a dollar or all I had to by this to my child or the person I love the most. And YOU should get 67 steps for you. To stay sane in this insane world. To know how. If anyone reads this far, thank you for your time and just try the 67 steps its food for your soul your heart your braaaain. Thank you Tai, from tbe bottom of my heart! One day I hope to meet my mentor in person I will do all thats needed.<br/>
                    Ps. Tai, why don\'t you make a 67 steps for kids? For all of your watchers, sisters brothers, kids? What\'s your thoughts on that?</div>

I\'ll be frank. I\'ve been through some shit this year. I have turned EVERY hardship into an opportunity thanks to the changes of mindframe presented in the 67 Steps. Thanks Tai.</div>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">The average American makes $51,017 a year yet is $225,238 in debt... As they say in poker, â€œif youâ€™ve been in the game for 30 minutes and donâ€™t know who the sucker is, youâ€™re the sucker.â€</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">You never want to be the sucker.</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">Imagine if you could have back the years you have wasted dating the wrong person; get back the money you lost on bad investments; take back the lost decades you spent in the wrong career.</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">The greatest wish of every human is to have their wasted years back, but how?</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">I asked myself many years ago, â€œIf there arenâ€™t 3 steps to get whatever you want, how many steps really are there? And if you canâ€™t get success overnight, how quickly can you actually make a big change?â€</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">Like the self-made billionaire Warren Buffett says, â€œYou only learn from mistakes. But they donâ€™t have to be your mistakes. Itâ€™s a hell of a lot easier to learn from the mistakes of others.â€</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">Start by asking yourself, are you so excited about life that you canâ€™t wait to wake up? Not many people are.</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">Since I was 16 years old I have traveled to 51 countries, read thousands of books, been mentored by 5 people (three millionaires and two closer to the billion dollar level). Started or invested in over a dozen multi-million dollar companies. I regularly charge training, coaching, and consulting anywhere from $1000 up to $1,000,000 per year.</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">My collection of principles, thoughts, and sayings has grown over the years. The problem now is that when I try to refer back to all this wisdom, the list has become too long and too hard to sort through.</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">I narrowed the list down to a more manageable number. I chose the number 67. That numberâ€™s based on new research by the University College London that found it takes about 66 days to form a new habit. So I added one more for good luck & came up with 67...</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">These Steps came from the teachings of powerful and famous people like Bill gates, Charlie Munger, Peter Drucker, Gandhi, and my personal mentors. Some are from my own personal experiences as an entrepreneur and from in-person meetings with some of the greatest minds around the globe.</p>

<p class=\"wow fadeIn\" data-wow-offset=\"300\">These 67 Steps will be your guide to avoiding the pain of a wasted life.</p>

<div class=\"quotes\">I can\'t tell you how much I needed to read this today. I began listening to you and made some giant life changes. I\'ve lost 100 pounds. I relocated for a better job to the west coast. I got stagnant and a little over whelmed again. I hate to admit it, but I got a little lazy as well.<br/>
This email reached my core, and reminded me where I buried my motivation. Sweet dreams to you, and thank you For helping me change my life. I also recommended your pod casts to a close friend of mine. He has since been able to start a business, and has been able to sustain his full time employment in it while growing the company.<br/>

My relationship with my girlfriend is better, I\'m drug free and live a healthier lifestyle. My relationship with my staff is better, and my practice is growing at a faster rate.My Search for self improvement began with a few YouTube searches and some Amazon book searches. How to quit weed\" turned up a book on amazon called \"No Need For Weed\" I read that book and then came across Tai\'s ad soon after Tai\'s 67 steps has helped me to solidify my new habit and I am continuing to read his suggested books.My accountant set me up with his top client who grosses 2.5 million, Dr. Champagne. He agreed to \"mentor\" me and I buy him books. I have since found other mentors including a dentist by the name of Dr. Seidner who grosses 6 million. I\'ve also been a more active member in the town Rotary Club, becoming more of a local celebrity. I can go on and on about my self improvements I would like to continue xpanding my business and perhaps invent a product, become a lecturer, or help others who have placed in my unique position.My unique position is that my father passed away while I was still a student. I managed to save my father\'s practice which was initially grossing $700,000 to $1,000,000. After My father\'s death it dipped well below $400,000. I have been able to bring i back up to $550,000. There is still much work to be done I need to continue to be healthy become a master of dentistry, spend more on patient education, and look toward a strategy for I want to build something unique don\'t know that I am in the or I\'ve found my true Eulerian Destiny, but certainly on my way and have Tai and his staff to thank that as healthy, did not drink or smoke and the is father passed from pancreatic cancer He no history of pancreatic cancer in our famil It is only fitting that I completed the 67 steps on father\'s day and im proud to be embarking on a ne journey.\"</div>

<div class=\"quotes\">Tai, it\'s amazing what happened in the last 24 hours after the live stream! Seems like I went from $2000 a day to $6123 a DAY! I attached a screenshot! Changes I made: 1) I was listening to your MBA, I heard you say BETA version of a product\", so I now position the coaching program as it was in a BETA phase and tell new clients the prices will triple soon (which is true!). Result - urgency, less complaints from clients later (it\'s BETA!) 2) I hired two people that were clients of mine - as you saw - they did a perfect job today! Thanks for such great advice - hiring from the inside! I wanted to hire somebody from the outside - how stupid of me! I like to think I\'m smart (though I\'m only 19), but the only thing I know - I know nothing! 3) I worked till 4am today to make the changes! Tai I want to meet you one day, but I know you only like hanging out with winners! I want to prove that before I meet you! Tai, you\'re the man! Thanks! Matt Pocius P.S. I\'ll join your Inner Circle soon! Attached now :) I am watching \"Crossing The Chasm - Marketing To The Pragmatists\". \"How many testimonials should you have? UNLIMITED!\" Will do!!! I now realize that I need to \"celebratize\" my product and become a celebrity in my market, I ignored it till now. I messaged a few people that will interview me! Can\'t wait to see results! One person already agreed! This is life changing advice from you, Tai!</div>

<div class=\"quotes\">The 67 Steps has been cool man. I honestly tell this to people. You know I paid to access to the 67 steps.The value that I get from the 67 steps program far far outweighs the value that I received from my Big 10 college education. It was so muddled... It was extended over 4 years... I didnâ€™t know if I was going to like what I was setting myself up to be doing after I graduated. The 67 step is just powerful. I feel like almost a world-class philosopher.<br/>
<br/>
For in-state tuition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne, itâ€™s in the neighborhood of about $100,000 or about $25,000 a year. I think a 18-year-old kid after high school could listen to these videos and maybe just delay going to college for just a semester, they would serve themselves very well. It would be a very wise decision.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class=\"item\">
<div class=\"container-quotes\">
<div class=\"quotes\">I just wanted to let you know I am currently half way through the 67 steps, and I\'m sure you get a lot of people telling you how much it\'s changed their life. And I would totally agree with them! I feel so energised, so light that I feel like I can fly, so buzzed and full of energy! I feel like I am an information absorbing machine! My business has already seen a 15 percent increase in sales and continuing to increase, by the end of the year I don\'t know what to expect. My physique has never looked better I am currently on 6%bf continuing to decrease while I keep my muscle mass, my wife and daughter are seeing a better father and husband! And it\'s only 32 days I don\'t know what it will be like when I finish the 67 steps I just know it\'s bloody awesome and you have me as a follower for life! I can\'t stop reading and learning as I work throughout the day in my business I have audio books playing just finished rich dad poor dad! And Sam Walton made in America, half way through Steven Covey effective habits! Sorry this message is long but I don\'t believe it\'s long enough to tell you of my deep appreciation of what you are currently and continuing to do for me in my life and the ones I love around me. Throught osmosis I know my circle will improve and continue to progress! Thank you again.</div>

<p>My goal is to change the world and I know that by making these 67 Steps essentially free I will reach a wider audience.</p>

<p>The 67 Steps are not a get-rich-quick scheme, although I am sure they can make you richer than youâ€™ve ever imagined. You will not lose 30 pounds overnight, although you can use these steps to get in the best shape of your life.</p>

<p>One of the most common questions I get is, â€œTai what is the best investment I can make?â€</p>

<p>Warren Buffett made $60 billion dollars as an investor in dozens of different industries but he still says, â€œThe Most Important investment you can make is in yourself.â€</p>

<p>You are probably already imagining the new and exciting life you are about to embark on. I say go for it. Let your mind wander and imagine the possibilities that fear has locked away from you for so long.</p>

<p>As the great UCLA basketball coach John Wooden said, â€œBe quick but not in a hurry.â€</p>

<p>Start immediately on these 67 Steps, donâ€™t procrastinate. But also understand that these are deep concepts designed to rewire your brain.</p>

<p>Because once you do (and Iâ€™m counting on you to do this), it will be a good life for you...</p>

<p>Stay strong,<br/>
